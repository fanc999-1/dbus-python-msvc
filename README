Please also refer to the dbus-python README file.

This is a set of NMake Makefiles along with patches to the distutils build
system (setup.py) that permits one to easily build dbus-python on Windows
using Visual Studio and build binary packages and/or wheels.

Other than the patch to setup.py and the addon files in nmake/, no other
patches are used against the vanilla dbus-python sources.
